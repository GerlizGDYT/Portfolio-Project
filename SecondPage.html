        <div class="Opening-Statement">
        <p> Hello, my name is Gerliz Herrera.  I graduated from Advanced Technology Academy back in 2020 with a 3.4 GPA and I graduated from Henry Ford College in 2021 with a 3.3 GPA.  I am currently getting my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Eastern Michigan University and I am expected to graduate in the year 2024.  At my high school, I did a program called the Early Middle College.  Thanks to that program, I was able to do both high school and college at the same time and obtain my Associates Degree a year after graduating high schoool.  My hobbies include makeup, video games, art, photography, and music.</p>
        <p> I am very interested in working at any Car Company that is offering a position in Automotive Engineering or Mechanical Engineering.  My career is mainly focused in cars and it would be amazing to work in that position if it is possible.  I am also willing to do any work that involves designing websites and CAD design.  My work experience involves working for Grow Detroit Youth Talent,DTE Energy, and Journi (which I curently work for).  From all workplaces, I have gained the experience of what it is like to work in a company, learn many different types of careers, and also how to code in certain languages. A thing about me is that I willing to put in the work and I will work really hard for anything that I want to achieve and take it seriously.</p>
